Loops
        A loop is used for executing a block of statements repeatedly until a particular
 condition is satisfied. A loop consists of an initialization statement, a test
 condition and an increment statement.

For Loop
The syntax of the for loop is  :

for (initialization; condition; update) {
 // body of-loop
}


While Loop
The syntax for while loop is :
while(condition) {
 // body of the loop
}



Do-While Loop
The syntax for the do-while loop is :
do {
 // body of loop;
}
while (condition);



Homework Problems
1. Print all even numbers till n.

2. Run
         for(; ;) {
            System.out.println("Sanket Pujari");
        }
        loop on your system and analyze what happens. Try to think of the reason
        for the output produced.

3. Make a menu-driven program. The user can enter 2 numbers, either 1 or 0.
   If the user enters 1 then keep taking input from the user for a student’s
   marks(out of 100).
    If they enter 0 then stop.
    If he/ she scores :
    Marks >=90 -> print “This is Good”
    89 >= Marks >= 60 -> print “This is also Good”
    59 >= Marks >= 0 -> print “This is Good as well”
	Because marks don’t matter but our effort does.
    (Hint : use do-while loop but think & understand why)


BONUS
Qs. Print if a number is prime or not (Input n from the user).
[In this problem you will learn how to check if a number is prime or not]
Homework Solution (Lecture 3)

import java.util.*;


public class Conditions {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
       Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
       int a = sc.nextInt();
       int b = sc.nextInt();
       int operator = sc.nextInt();


       /**

        * 4 -> /
        * 5 -> %
        */


       switch(operator) {
           case 1 : System.out.println(a+b);
           break;
           case 2 : System.out.println(a-b);
           break;
           case 3 : System.out.println(a*b);
           break;
           case 4 : if(b == 0) {
                       System.out.println("Invalid Division");
                   } else {
                       System.out.println(a/b);
                   }
	    break;

                       System.out.println("Invalid Division");
                   } else {
                       System.out.println(a%b);
                   }
	    break;
           default : System.out.println("Invalid Operator");
       }
